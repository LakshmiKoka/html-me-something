            Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has several plots and a large
            ensemble cast, and follows several story arcs.
            One arc is about the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms, and follows a web of alliances and conflicts among
            the noble dynasties either vying to claim
            the throne or fighting for independence from it. Another focuses on the last descendant of the realm's
            deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled and
            is plotting a return to the throne, while another story arc follows the Night's Watch, a brotherhood
            defending the realm against the fierce peoples and
            legendary creatures of the North.

        <p>
            Members of the Night’s Watch, an ancient order guarding the Wall to the north of Westeros, encounter a
            supernatural being known as a White Walker in the
            forest, previously assumed to be mythical.Ned Stark (Sean Bean), Warden of the North, is visited in
            Winterfell by Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) and invited
            to serve at his side following the sudden death of Jon Arryn, the previous Hand of the King. Stark’s
            daughters Sansa (Turner) and Arya (Williams) travel
            with him to King’s Landing but find the corrupt city-state in disarray.The family of Baratheon’s bride,
            Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), are allegedly behind
            the killing of Arryn. His son Bran (Isaac Hempstead Wright) witnesses Cersei in bed with her brother Jaime
            (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), who shoves him from a tower
            window, leaving Bran paralysed. Tyrion Lannister (Dinklage), a dwarf dilettante, accompanies Ned’s bastard
            son Jon Snow (Harrington) to investigate the White Walker
            incident reported by the Night’s Watch. Snow stays on with the order. Tyrion is arrested at the behest of
            Catelyn Stark (Michelle Fairley), who believes him responsible
            for Bran’s fall, prompting a trial by combat to secure his release. Tyrion, imprisoned in the Vale under the
            watchful eye of Catelyn’s sister Lysa Arryn (Kate Dickie),
            enlists Bronn (Jerome Flynn) to fight for him. He defeats Arryn’s chosen champion.When Baratheon is fatally
            wounded in a suspicious hunting accident, Ned is named Protector
            of the Realm until Cersei’s sadistic son Joffrey (Jack Gleeson) comes of age. Ned, however, plans to instal
            Stannis Baratheon (Stephen Dillane), the king’s estranged brother,
            in his stead. Ned is betrayed by councillor Lord Petyr “Littlefinger” Baelish (Aidan Gillan) and decapitated
            on Joffrey’s orders.Sansa is arrested by the Lannisters as Arya
            manages to escape. In response, Stark’s son Robb (Madden) is named King of Winterfell and rallies the armies
            of the North against the Lannisters.Across the Narrow Sea, Dothraki
            warlord Khal Drogo (Jason Mamoa) marries Daenerys Targaryen (Clarke). She believes herself the true heir to
            the Iron Throne and plots an assault on Westeros. Drogo dies after
            being hexed by a witch. Daenerys avenges him and hatches three dragon eggs presented to her as a wedding
            gift.

            witch Melisandre (Carice van Houten) and publicly lays claim to the throne
            on the basis of Joffrey’s illegitimacy. Robb’s armies progress south with Jaime Lannister as their prisoner
            of war. Robb sends Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen) to seek an alliance with
            his father, Balon Greyjoy (Patrick Malahide). Instead, Theon reunites with his family on the Iron Islands

            bodyguard, Brienne of Tarth (Gwendolyn Christie), are accused of the assassination
            and forced to flee. Uniting with Robb once more, the women conspire to have Jaime returned to King’s Landing
            in the hope of swapping him for Sansa.At the Wall, Jon Snow uncovers evidence
            of infant sacrifices and defects from the Night’s Watch to join the Wildlings. Arya is captured by Lannister
            soldiers, imprisoned at the castle of Harrenhal and taken on as a servant by

            support for her invasion of Westeros. She ends up imprisoned in the House of the Undying, along with her
            dragons, after being drawn into a usurpation plot. She eventually escapes and pillages

            to Castle Black. Stannis Baratheon’s remaining men ride to the rescue, now backed by the financiers of the
            Iron Bank. Arya and The Hound are found by Brienne, who defeats Clegane in battle. Arya runs

            the disapproval of the guard’s elders. Stannis is later convinced by Melisandre to sacrifice his
            own daughter to appease the “Lord of Light” and hold back the winter snows. He burns her alive, losing the
            respect of his own troops. Littlefinger leads Sansa to Ramsay Bolton with the intention of marrying
            them, an event that would mean the return of the Starks to Winterfell.Stannis arrives to fight the Boltons

            takes over the city of Mereen with her Unsullied army. However, she struggles to retain control of the
            desert slave city when an anonymous collective known as the Sons of the Harpy rise up against her. After a
            battle between her guards and the Harpies, one of Daenerys’s dragons whisks her away and into the
            midst of a Dothraki horde. Tyrion meets Daenerys, quickly wins her trust and is left to rule in her absence.
